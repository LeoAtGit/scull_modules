In this folder (scull1/) you can change around the different branches to see different examples of how locking is implemented.

You can switch between branches by using the command 
	
	git checkout origin/name_of_branch 

and you can see the name of the branch when you first pull from it or in the web interface of github. And of course it is listed here:

 - completion
 - deadlock
 - deadlock_not_interruptible
